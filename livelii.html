              <p style="font-size:24px;">Independent workers in Canada face obstacles getting a mortgage. 
                This project explored how Livelii might offer a competitive mortgage product 
                that would support the lifestyle and financial needs of Canadians who are self-employed or 
                work as independent contractors.</p>

              client needs and design a user journey based on gained insights. I collected data on Livelii’s 
              customer base by conducting virtual interviews and a survey, applying Lean UX and Design Studio 
              methods to create a product prototype that would help company leadership better understand the market.

            <p>To understand this problem space, we wanted to validate assumptions that we had going into this
              project. We began by writing down our assumptions and brainstorming some protopersonas. Responses
              from my interviews and survey, as well as research into competing mortgage products, gave me
              a more nuanced understanding of our client's needs and motivations.

                <p>We believe that Livelii can provide affordable mortgage options to independent workers in

            <p>To do this, I created three protopersonas, representing three different types of
              independent workers: freelancers, independent contractors, and sole proprietors. Asking
              myself basic questions about these types of clients helped me see the gaps in my knowledge.</p>

            <p>I interviewed a few of Livelii's clients to gain a clearer picture of their experiences with
              personal finances, planning toward home ownership, and applying for mortgages. To complement
              this qualitative research, I also designed a survey to help me understand where our target clients
              might be coming from and what they wanted.

            <p>I built three protopersonas around information available online from government websites and other mortgage lenders. 
              These early personas helped me prepare interview and survey questions. We decided to focus on two personas based on 
              our two interview participants.

              website that I could use to present the product idea to company leadership. To get there, I laid out a user journey

                <p>Our primary goal would be to offer competitive mortgage rates and mortgage application process tailored to the 
                  unique situations of independent workers in Canada. To support that goal, we decided it was important to add supports

              for a mortgage down the road.

            <h3>The information architecture communicates and enables this user journey.</h3>
            <p>I created a basic layout for the website’s information architecture to visualize how users would navigate our 
              primary user flows and move through the user journey. The website needed to help potential customers understand the 
              three tracks available to them&mdash;mortgage, savings, and credit score&mdash;and set up an appointment with a customer 
              representative.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also worked out the information architecture for a dashboard prototype. The dashboard is a portal where customers can 
              submit documents, track their savings or credit score, and interact with the company.

            <!--Low Fidelity-->
            <h3>Low fidelity wireframes focused on visual layout.</h3>
            <p>In my low fidelity wireframes, I focused on some ground-level visual design choices: typescript, spacing, and 
              placement of information and how those would enable navigation

            <!--High Fidelity Mockups-->
            <h3>High fidelity mockups focused on use of color and images.</h3>
            <p>In my high fidelity mockups, I considered how a color scheme would reinforce design. I chose calm, analogous 
              colors associated with stability and trustworthiness that wouldn’t compete for attention with the text. The images 
              I included also are intended to support the text.

          <p>My final deliverable was a clickable Figma prototype that I used to demonstrate the product concept to company 
            leadership. This prototype could then ideally be used to continue testing hypotheses about this product. I believe 
            that visual design and creativity are just one side of making a successful product. These aspects of design work best 
            when they support the more brainy things such as information architecture, user flows, and user interactions. Not only 
            should these conceptual things be tested in the design process but aesthetic choices should as well.</p>
