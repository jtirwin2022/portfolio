                helps college students navigate the intimidating and sometimes frustrating process of finding 
                sources for their papers. In addition to the process of research and design, this project also involved making 
                an original logo and a marketing website for the product (using only HTML and CSS).</p>

            <p>Research Guru is a concept app designed for college students who need a more intuitive, 
                accessible way to find and evaluate sources for their papers. Students often do not know how to
                use the array of online search tools available to them and don't know how to distinguish one source
                from another. The app helps them think about their search parameters and also generates keywords 
                based on their research question. The advanced search tools are also easy to use. The app doesn't 
                spoon feed results, but instead helps students learn the fundamentals of research.</p>

              I describe how I came to define a problem statement through my research and then design a prototype
              that is ready for testing.

          <div class="row">
            <h2 id="phase1" class="h-position">Phase 1: Empathize & Define</h2>
            <p>To understand this problem space, I wanted to validate assumptions that I had going into this
              project. I wanted to design for both students and teachers. This app would not only help students 
              do research but would also reinforce learning goals that college instructors might set for their 
              students. I interviewed a college instructor as well as former students to pick their brains about 
              their experiences in this area. I also conducted usability studies on library websites and analyzed 
              existing research apps on the market to understand what my designs could do differently.
            </p>
            <h3>My Starting Point: Teaching</h3>
            <p>I worked as a college writing instructor at a community college in the US. Many of my students 
                came to their first semester of college with little exposure to academic research and writing. 
                It was a whole new world to them. I saw that my students avoided using the library search engine to 
                find academic sources, instead relying on Google. They struggled to distinguish academic sources 
                from popular sources, journal articles from blogs. 
            <br><br> 
                I realized that my college library’s “search engine”&mdash;and most other college library “search 
                engines”&mdash; are designed around the idea that users already know how to use those tools. But 
                there are too many options, too many strange words. Students not only struggle to grasp concepts 
                about research, but they struggle to understand the tools colleges are giving them to do research.</p>

            <h3>Usability Study</h3>
            <p>I asked two college students to search for sources using the 
            <a href="https://library.conestogac.on.ca/" target="_blank">Conestoga College Library</a> 
            and the <a href="https://library.nwacc.edu/home" target="_blank">Northwest Arkansas Community 
            College Library*</a> websites. My reason for doing this was to help me identify user needs and 
            pain points that I could address in my designs.</p>
            
            <p style="font-size:16px;">*The UI of the NWACC Library page has since been updated since my project was 
            completed.</p>

              <h4>What stood out from the usability study</h4>
              <ul class="emoji-list">
                <li class="pb-1">One participant confused “advanced search” with a menu that filters results 
                  by source type.</li>
                <li class="pb-1">Neither participant used the Advanced Search feature.</li>
                <li class="pb-1">It took one participant four tries before he found the results he needed. He kept changing 
                  the keywords he was using to search with until he found what he was looking for.</li>
                <li class="pb-1">I wonder if students use these library websites like a slot machine, not realizing that 
                  they can have more control over the output of the search. It doesn’t seem like those 
                  advanced tools are used.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <!--Callout-->
            <div class="callout-bordered ps-3 mb-5">
              <p>Based on this usability study, I asked myself how I might improve the accessibility and user 
                  experience of advanced search tools and how I might design the app so that users would not 
                  have to use advanced search tools to find what they need, if they preferred not to.</p>
            </div>
            <!--Interviews-->
            <h3>Interviews with College Graduates </h3>
            <p>I interviewed the same two usability study participants about their experiences doing research 
              for humanities courses in college. My notes from the interviews are available 
              <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IAnmCKfgzcx91olQT9CLQKlaOCJUequ8dBb_5JurdRg/edit"
                target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
            <div>
              <h4>Takeaways from the interviews</h4>
              <ul class="emoji-list">
                <li class="pb-1">Not all students do a lot of academic research that requires using a library 
                  search engine during college, especially if they are in the hard sciences.</li>
                <li class="pb-1">These two guys wanted to get results quickly. They’re used to the efficiency 
                  and usability of Google and prefer that level of user experience.</li>
                <li class="pb-1">One of them is frustrated at how slightly different keyword searches yield 
                  really different results. A library website search is not optimized to find what you need 
                  without a lot of effort on your part as a user.</li>
                <li class="pb-1">They both like learning things and enjoy finding that perfect source that works 
                  for their paper or leads them further in their research.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <h3>Interview with a stakeholder&mdash;a college instructor</h3>
            <p>I interviewed a college writing instructor who teaches at Conestoga College. She and I talked 
              about how she teaches students to do research and what she emphasizes in the process. I shared 
              my ideas about a research app and what services it might provide to students.</p>
            <div>
              <h4>Takeaways from the interview</h4>
              <ul class="emoji-list">
                <li class="pb-1">She wants students to be able to distinguish credible sources from non-credible 
                  sources rather than focus on the differences between scholarly and popular sources. </li>
                <li class="pb-1">She said students shouldn’t get help from an app to develop a research question. 
                  Developing a research question takes practice; it’s all about strengthening the thinking process. </li>
                <li class="pb-1">When using library search engines, she teaches students to use limiters, keywords, 
                  and dates. </li>
                <li class="pb-1">When viewing search results, she directs students to the visual cues (icons/images) 
                  associated with source type.</li>

            <!--Reading-->
            <h3>Secondary Reading</h3>
            <p>I read “Assessing the Scope and Feasibility of First-Year Students’ Research Paper Topics” by Erin 
              Rinto, Melissa Bowles-Terry, and Ariel J. Santos, published in College & Research Libraries in 2016,
              to see how I might design an app rooted in pedagogical theory.</p>

              <h4>What stood out to me</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Developing a good research question is essential for students to be successful in their 
                  research and writing.</li>
                <li>Students struggle to understand what a good research question is. This takes practice and 
                  scaffolding support.</li>
                <li>A good research question has researchability, appropriate breadth, language context, and 
                  arguability. These categories were used to assess student writing in the article. </li>
              </ul>
              <p style="font-weight:500;">Based on this reading, I asked myself, how might an app provide scaffolding support to students 
                to write good research questions based on these criteria?</p>

            <p>Having defined the problem, I asked myself <em>What features could effectively address the needs
              and frustrations of students and teachers?</em> In this section, I first explain what those features 
              are and then share the steps of my design process&mdash;the user flow, sketches, wireframes, visual
              design, and branding.

            <h3>Diving Deeper</h3>
            <p>Based on insights from my research, I focused on building three features in the prototype:
              keyword suggestions, simplified advanced search tools, and easy-to-understand search results.
              Below, I share my rationale for those three focal points in the app.

            <!--Process-->
            <h3>Designing a Prototype</h3>
            <p>Although my design process was not as linear as it appears here, I kept to a method to help me 
              anticipate as many details as I could. After some ideation, I created a user flow, sketched low
              fidelity wireframes, fleshed those sketches out into digital medium fidelity, and finished with
              a high fidelity clickable prototype.
            </p>
            <!--Ideation-->
            <h4>Ideation</h4>
            <p>I like to generate ideas using mind maps&mdash;lots of scribbles and arrows. Here 
              you can see how I've done this in my notes.

            </figure>
            <!--User Flow-->
            <h4>User Flow</h4>
            <p>I knew the user interactions in the app would be important, as the app is designed to tutor students.
              I asked myself <em>What would users be thinking or need help with at each point they needed to make a 
              decision in the app?</em> The secondary reading I did earlier in my research helped me think about
              how the app could play that assistive role.

            <h4>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h4>
            <p>In these sketches, I worked out the information I thought was needed on each screen and
              the basic visual layout of that information. I also noted some of the interactions that would
              be a part of certain screens.</p>

            <p>This project was a big undertaking working on my own. Although this app is partly a redesign of
              a product that already exists, it also takes on the additional role of a tutor. The success of this
              app would depend on how approachable, desirable, and functional that tutor role is to students.
