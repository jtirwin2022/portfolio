                enrich the physical experience of visiting a zoo through personalization and gamification.

            <p>Zoofari is an app that zoo visitors can use to plan their day and gamify their experience at the zoo.
              During research our team found that parents with kids needed a simple way to access scheduled events. 
              And zoo visitors of all ages needed a fun way to learn about animals at their own pace. We designed 
              a concept app that addressed these user needs with an eye for adventure and delight.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">The project began with research and continued with Design Studio activities
              to help us converge. As a project manager, I coordinated our team's week-to-week tasks and meetings. 
              We used a Trello Kanban board to keep track of our progress and deadlines. While we all contributed to 
              various stages of research and design, we chose to divide the workload and each focus our efforts 
              on separate stages of design. Most of my energy went into research, but I also contributed to 
              sketching, wireframing and mockups. Others in the group managed the low and high fidelity mockups.</p>

            <h3>Constraints</h3>
            <p>We worked on the project remotely from start to finish. Our meetings and collaborations took into 
              account that one of our team members lives in India while we were working in Canada. We communicated 
              in a WhatsApp group and Zoom meetings and worked synchronously on InVision and Figma.</p>   
          </div>
         
          <!-- Phase 1 -->
          <div class="row">
            <h2 id="phase1" class="h-position">Discover</h2>
            <p>We were given the task of building a prototype for an app that makes going to the zoo a more enjoyable 
              and educational experience. We wanted to make something that would be both fun and useful, complementing 
              the physical experience of the zoo.</p>
            <p>‚ÄçTo find our angle into this problem space, we performed competitive market research and qualitative 
              research to identify user needs and begin the design studio process.</p>
            <p>After a brainstorming session focused on research methods, assumptions, questions, and ideas, my 
              team member Tee and I began research. This included an interview, analysis of existing 
              zoo apps, and visits to both indoor and outdoor zoos. Based on this research, we created empathy 
              maps and personas to keep our designs focused on user needs.</p>
            <p>We uncovered a significant amount of information about user needs and habits for different age 
              groups. Zoo visitors wanted a way to keep up to date with daily events at the zoo. They also wanted 
              to feel like they had options. And, contrary to what we assumed, many didn't mind carrying their 
              phones in their hand for long periods of time at the zoo.</p>

            <!--Interview-->
            <h3>My Interview</h3>
            <p>I interviewed a family of five&mdash;2 parents and 3 adult children&mdash;who used to live in Toronto 
              and regularly visited the Toronto Zoo as part of their homeschool curriculum. The interview took place 
              in the family living room. Most of my prepared questions were answered in the conversation that we had.

                <h4>My Approach to the Interview</h4>
                <p>I phrased my questions based on examples from 
                  <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/harvarduxgroup/files/ux-research-guide-sample-questions-for-user-interviews.pdf"
                  target="_blank">Starter Questions For User Research by Sarah Doody</a>. 
                  My goal was to learn more about the pain points for a family with kids visiting a zoo and also 
                  what made zoo visits delightful so that our designs could address some of those frustrations and 
                  reinforce already existing positive experiences. The interview questions were investigating the 
                  validity of our assumptions about potential app features and user journeys.</p>

            <!--Competitive Research-->
            <h3>Competitive Research</h3>
            <p>I looked for zoo visitor apps already on the market on Google Play and the Apple App Store. Reading 
              through reviews for each app, I made a list of positive and negative comments to help me identify 
              user needs and pain points that our team could take into account in designing our own prototype.</p>

            <!--Field Observations-->
            <h3>Field Observations: Zoo Visits</h3>
            <p>Tee and I each visited a zoo space to think about the intersections of an app user experience and the 
              physical zoo experience. Tee visited the Montreal Biodome, and I visited the outdoor Eby Farm in 
              Waterloo Park. Even though Eby Farm was empty for the winter season, I still came away with insights from 
              my observations.</p>

            <!--Empathy Maps-->
            <h3>Empathy Maps</h3>
            <p>I made two empathy maps, drawing from my interview responses and from my competitive research, based 
              on user review comments of other apps and on my interview responses. This helped me visualize who 
              our users are and the pain points they face in existing user journeys.</p>

            <!--User Needs-->
            <h3>User Needs</h3>
            <p>I discovered many user needs from my preliminary research. To avoid overlooking any user needs,
              however small, I listed as many as I could, generating over 30. Later, I grouped as many of those
              needs together as I could, creating two bigger-picture needs, shown in blue below.
            </p>

            <!--Problem Statements-->
            <h3>Problem Statements</h3>
            <p>I considered the many user needs from our research and wrote two problem statements that our 
              prototype might focus on. In addition to those two problem statements, I wanted to include related, 
              satellite user needs that would inform smaller design decisions.</p>

            <p>Tee and I drafted two user personas that correlate with our two problem statements. These personas 
              reflect two types of users: young professionals looking to have a fun day out with friends and a 
              parent with kids visiting the zoo.</p>

            <h2 id="phase3" class="h-position">Build</h2>
            <p>After voting on solutions, we designed a clickable prototype, getting there by creating
              sketches, wireframes, a user flow, user stories, and branding guidelines. Tee and Arham took
              the lead on this phase of the design process, while I helped as needed.

            <!--Features Callouts-->
            <h3>The Features We Chose to Build</h3>
            <div>
              <div class="callout-bordered mb-4">
                <h4>"Today" Event Scheduling and Reminders</h4>
                <p>A tab on the homescreen takes users to a list of events occurring on any given day at the zoo.
                  Users can select the events they plan to attend, and the app will notify them when it's time
                  to make their way to the event.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="callout-bordered mb-4">
                <h4>Scavenger Hunt</h4>
                <p>Users receive personalized lists of scavenger hunt goals in their "List" based on the scavenger
                  hunt onboarding process. The backpack icon lets users access tools they need for the game, such
                  as the camera. Once users have completed all the goals on their lists, they receive a chance to
                  win a discount at one of the restaurants or gift shops in the zoo.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="callout-bordered mb-4">
                <h4>Navigation Map</h4>
                <p>All roads eventaully lead to the map. This features works both with the "Today" and Scavenger Hunt
                  tools on the app, showing were users are currently located and their next destination. The map is
                  also customizable&mdash;a filter button brings up a list of options that enhance the Scavenger Hunt
                  experience and show the user essential facilities and areas of the zoo.</p>

            <!--Sketches-->
            <h3>Sketches</h3>
            <p>I sketched out the navigation map as it would look for zoo navigation and the scavenger hunt.
              We wanted to make the map customizable. Thus my experimentation with filter buttons.

            <!--Low Fidelity Wireframes-->
            <h4>Low Fidelity Wireframes</h4>
            <p>We converted our sketches to low fidelity wireframes on InVision. This helped us generate ideas
              for visual design, interactions, and the hierarchy of information.
            </p>

            <p>We built two task flows to demonstrate key functionality for the solutions to our original two

              designers.</p>

                <p>In response to our presentation of this project to UX designers, we received feedback that the 
                  child-like aesthetic of the app may turn off some potential users. Overall, the designers were 
                  excited about the app and its potential.</p>

                <li>Our app is designed to work for zoos in general, not a specific one. I think, if this project
                  were to move forward, we would need to choose a specific zoo to design for, customizing the
                  features for the needs of that particular zoo and its visitors.
                </li>
                <li>The prototype demonstrates two task flows&mdash;given more time, our next step would be to design
                  a more developed user flow and conduct user testing.
                </li>
                <li>We might modify the aesthetic of the app to be more relatable to zoo visitors without kids. It
                  would be helpful to do A/B and usability testing to learn if users prefer <em>playful</em> or
                  <em>less playful</em>.
