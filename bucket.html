              <p style="font-size:24px;">Following Lean UX principles, my team

            <p>Bucket is an app prototype designed to connect young professionals, who may find it challenging to compost 
              individually, with composting communities and to track their composting contributions. Gamification 
              and community are part of the experience to encourage team composting. As they join local teams of composters 
              and participate in app-based competitions, these young professionals can feel more motivated and satisfied 
              with their composting experience.</p>

              Using research as a starting point and sounding board, our aim was to fail fast&mdash;to continually 
              reassess our understanding of the problem and its best solution. We used elements of the Design Studio 
              to facilitate our design process and team cohesion. The project follows three phases: Discover, Explore, 
              Build.</p>

          <!-- Phase 1 -->
          <div class="row">
            <h2 id="phase1" class="h-position">Discover</h2>
            <p>In the first phase, we wanted to indentify a specific problem and understand the people we were designing for. 
              We began by conducting interviews and making empathy maps to see if we could spot some shared pains among 
              participants. From there, we drafted a problem statement and agreed on the characteristics of our protopersona.
            </p>
            <h3>Interviews</h3>
            <p>We wanted to come prepared with questions to our interviews but be flexible enough to probe further whereever
              the conversation led. At Ewa Plonka’s suggestion, our team put together an interview conversation tree. 
              a branching set of interview questions designed to help us adjust course during our interviews 
              based on the participants’ answers and attitude toward the topic. As we prepared the interview questions, 
              I phrased mine to be open-ended, based on examples from <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/harvarduxgroup/files/ux-research-guide-sample-questions-for-user-interviews.pdf"
               target="_blank">Starter Questions For User Research by Sarah Doody</a>.
              <br><br> 
              Our goal was to discover environment-related interests and frustrations among the interview participants 
              and their communities. We focused our questions around the topics of environmentally-friendly products, 
              services, and personal habits.</p>

                <ul class="emoji-list">
                  <li class="pb-3">We discovered that people have the desire to engage in environmentally friendly practices but 
                  are often frustrated or apathetic about those practices, as they either don't know how to go about 
                  it or they see that the value of these practices is outweighed by the inconveniences.</li>
                  <li>Besides the themes of inconvenience and lack of knowledge, we also discovered problem spaces in
                  areas of physical and mental health and lack of awareness about environmentally positive initiatives
                  where our participants lived.</li>

            <!--Empathy Maps-->
            <h3>Empathy Maps</h3>
            <p>Looking at our empathy maps, we discovered some converging trends. Participants said they would like to 
              practice more environmentally friendly habits. They frequently felt frustrated at the lack of options 
              and/or knowledge available. They commented on the lack of local green initiatives or problems with those 
              initiatives. And they criticized single-use products. At the same time, participants' actions sometimes 
              contradicted what they thought.</p>

              <ul class="emoji-list">
                <li class="pb-3">We found that although our participants were all eager to practice more environmentally friendly habits, they 
                  struggled making impactful changes to their habits due to cost and convenience factors outweighing environmentally friendly 
                  habits.</li>
                <li>Another common issue we found during our empathy mapping phase was that our participants felt as though 
                  their individual impact on the environment felt miniscule and therefore, not valuable. Participants believed they didn't have the power as individuals to make a 
                  difference.</li>

            <!--Problem Statement-->
            <h3>Converging on a Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>Based on notes from our interviews and empathy maps, we tried to identify as many problems or needs as
              we could. Generating this list helped us come together as a group and decide on the direction of the project.
            </p>
            <figure class="figure mb-4">
              <img class="figure-img img-fluid img-thumbnail" src="img/bucket/ps.jpg" alt="Our brainstorm list for problems and needs.">
              <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Our combined list of problems and needs.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h4>Addressing Differences in Demographics</h4>
            <p>While our interview participants were similar in age (between 20 and 30 years old) and live in cities, they 
            reside in different parts of the world: India, the Philippines, and Canada. Naturally, specific environmental 
            problems that came up during interviews differed based on geographic location. Because of these differing 
            contexts, it was a challenge to identify converging issues we might address so we chose one issue that surfaced 
            in more than one interview: frustrations with composting.</p>
            <h4>Understanding Variables at Play in the Problem</h4>
            <p>We saw a need to define a problem statement that addressed the community (both individuals and businesses) to a degree. 
              In the Kitchener community, composting has a small following. During our participant interviews, the reasoning 
              for limited composting practices seem to be linked to a lack of resources and convenience. Although most 
              participants were pro-composting, none of the five individuals we interviewed actually practiced composting at 
              home effectively or in a fulfilling way.</p>

              <div class="callout-blue-shadow ps-3">
                <h4>Our First Problem Statement</h4>
                <p>In general, we have noticed that people value convenience over the time, knowledge, and cost involved in 
                  making green choices, such as purchasing environmentally friendly products or recycling/composting. </p>
                <p>There are composting services out there, but lack of convenient and affordable resources/services make it 
                  difficult to practice composting as a collective community (both individual households and businesses). </p>
                <p>How might we help the community engage in healthier composting practices and be more satisfied with their 
                  composting experience?”</p>

            <!--Persona-->
            <h3>Drafting a Persona</h3>
            <p>We chose to focus on a target audience of young professionals that live in Kitchener, Ontario, who are 
              interested in composting but lack knowledge or resources to compost regularly.</p>

            <p>We each wrote down our questions and assumptions related to the challenges of composting and 
              then compiled them. This step helped us identify what we knew (or thought we knew), what we didn't
              know, and, ultimately, what we needed to learn from further research and testing.

              we dot-voted on the solutions that were most desirable to users/customers, viable as a business,
              technically feasible, and ethical. We then circled areas of greatest agreement and convergence.</p>

            <h2 id="phase3" class="h-position">Build</h2>
            <p>In this phase of the project, we did Crazy 8s and 3 Panel Sketches to generate specific ideas for
              screen interactions. We revisited our hypothesis and began making an app prototype that we
              could use for the first stages of usability testing. Based on critique from other groups in the class,
              we simplified our user flow and narrowed our scope even further.
            </p>
            <!--Revised Hypothesis-->
            <h3>Our Revised Hypothesis</h3>
            <p>Based on the work we had done in Phase 2, I revised the hypothesis to avoid designing too many features 
              in our prototype and to nail down what our minimum viable product might look like. It includes a statement 
              describing how we would validate our assumptions.</p>

                to our hypothesis.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <!--User Flow Revision-->
            <h3>User Flow Revision</h3>
            <p>Our initial user flow was too feature heavy. From our classmates’ and instructor’s critique, we realized that we 
              needed to simplify the scope of our prototype and focus on the task flows that directly addressed our problem statement 
              and hypothesis. Given the constraints of the project, we decided to shelf extra features such as journal entry flow and 
              settings and focus on how user would create a profile, join a team, enter compost contributions, and track contributions 
              in a wider community.</p>
            <h4>Old User Flow</h4>

                <img class="figure-img img-fluid img-thumbnail" src="img/bucket/userFlow1.jpg" alt="Our first user flow.">
                <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Our first user flow. As you can see, it is quite sprawling.</figcaption>
              </figure>
            <h4>New User Flow</h4>
              <p>When a new user first loads the app, the app will redirect them immediately to creating an account for themselves. 
              If the user is a returning user, the app will automatically redirect them to the home screen. This design is to 
              help facilitate a smooth onboarding experience as a profile is absolutely needed to help track and join a 
              composting team.</p>

                  before building all features.</figcaption>
              </figure>
             <!--Low Fidelity--> 
            <h3>Designing Features in Low Fidelity</h3>
            <p>Based on the sketches that we had done, we designed a set of low-fidelity screens for our minimum viable
              product. These screens demonstrate the primary interactions users would encounter in the app.

            </div>
            <!--Medium Fidelity-->
            <h4>Medium Fidelity</h4>
            <p>Before creating a clickable prototype on Figma for testing, we added more detail to the screens and added a 
              hamburger menu in the top right corner for navigation. We finished this project having built a 
              simple prototype that we could test for usability and to validate our assumptions.</p>

                  <li>Test our medium-fidelity prototype for usability and to validate assumptions.</li>
                  <li>If needed, make changes to the features and solutions we had chosen.</li>
                  <li>Implement our findings from usability testing into the next version of the prototype:
                    high fidelity.
                  </li>
                  <li>Add branding elements, such as colour, typeface, and spacing.</li>
                  <li>Test again.</li>

            <p>This is just the beginning of a long project and is still at the research stages. Here are some
              things we could have done differently in the process or that we could do if we were to continue
              this project:</p>
            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>It would have been good to limit our research to a specific geographical area rather than
                  interview people across the globe. We realized different cities and regions face unique environmental
                  challenges so defining a problem that represents everyone is hard to do.
                </li>
                <li>We could have tested our low-fidelity screens to help us design for medium fidelity. Feedback
                  at each stage of the build process would have helped us narrow our scope and understand if our
                  solutions were desirable and functional.
                </li>
                <li>Once we had defined a problem, we could have created a few personas based on further research 
                  into composting in the Kitchener area.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
